## Description
For my final project, I will be creating an interactive and aesthetically pleasing schedule builder for content creation, specifically livestreaming. As someone who is getting more into livestreaming and content creation myself, this will be a useful tool for me to upload my schedule for the week to social media in the future.

## Features
- Interactive Display
- Dropdown to pick dates, days, and times
- Option to upload art or other image in provided space
- Textbox to enter titles and details
- Option to customize colors and styles
- Several different aesthetic design choices

## Challenges
- Date picking UI
- Other interactive UI
- Implementing choices
- Designing styles and implementing

## Outcomes
### Ideal Outcome
I hope to create something that works efficiently enough and looks aesthetic enough for me to actually use when creating schedules for my own streams. I have an aesthetic I am going for and I want it to live up to my standards for it.
### Minimal Viable Outcome
At the very least, I want to be able to manually enter each piece of information into their respective locations on a design that at least gets the point across that it's a stream schedule.

## Milestones
### Week 1 - Nov 3-9
